1. Clone repository to any location
2. Copy env.sh.dist to env.sh (cp env.sh.dist env.sh)
3. Adjust env.sh to contain path to project module on which you're developing (example: /var/www/html/testproject/app/code/Creatuity/OrderStatusAdjust)
4. When you'll want to commit your code, simply run ./sync.sh - it will copy files from project module to this repository
5. Commit and push
